# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

INTRUCTIONS

SERVER OR BACKEND
Firstly move to the server directory eg: cd server

1. Create a .env file
    The .env file will contain the following:
    i. MONGODB_URL = database connection string
    ii. JWT_SECRET_KEY = your secreate key
    iii. PORT = 8800
    iv. AUTH_EMAIL= email address
    v. AUTH_PASSWORD=email access password
    vi. APP_URL = http://localhost:8800/api-v1

    Note: I used hotmail account to send verification email, so you can just create one 
    because hotmail account is reliable in product and has no configuration.

    Alos, chnage API_URL when you deploy your app else use localhost with the appropriate port number

2. Run npm install to install the packages
3. Run npm start to start the server


CLINET SIDE

The client or frontend also has .env filde in the root folder. 
Create an environment variable of name REACT_APP_CLOUDINARY_ID.
This will store the cloudinary cloud name
